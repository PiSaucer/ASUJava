# 18. NumberGuessingGame

**Description:** Guess a hidden number between 1 and 1000. The program uses a do-while loop to keep the iteration going until the user gets the correct number. The program gives the user a "higher/lower" hint after each guess.

## Code

```java
package asu.numberguessinggame;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberGuessingGame {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int secretNumber;
        secretNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 999 + 1);
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        int guess;
        do {
            System.out.println("Enter a guess (1-1000): ");
            guess = keyboard.nextInt();
            if (guess == secretNumber)
                System.out.println("Your guess is correct. Congratulations!");
            else if (guess < secretNumber)
                System.out.println("Your guess is smaller than the secret number.");
            else if (guess > secretNumber)
                System.out.println("Your guess is greater than the secret number.");
            } while (guess != secretNumber);
    }
}
```
