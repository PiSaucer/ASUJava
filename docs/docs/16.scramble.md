# 16. Scramble

**Description:** Scramble the words in a paragraph by shuffling the internal letters of each word, keeping the first and last letters in place.

## Code

```java

public class Scramble {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sentence = "According to research at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter \nin what order the letters in a word are, \nthe only important thing is that the first and last \nletters be at the right place. The Rest can\nbe a total mess and you can still read it \nwithout problem. This is because the human mind does \nnot read every letter by itself, but the word\nas a whole";
        
        String out = "";
