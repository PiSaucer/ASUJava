# 06. Factorial

**Description:** Computes the factorial of a given integer in two ways: iterative \(with a loop\) and recurively \(self-referencing method\).

## Type in code:

```java
package asu.factorial;

public class Factorial {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;
        int factorial = 1;

        //first way (without recursion)
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            factorial = i * factorial;
        }

        System.out.println(n + " factorial (iterative) = " + factorial);

        //second way (with recursion)
        factorial = getFactorial(n);

        System.out.println(n + " factorial (recursive) = " + factorial);
    }

    public static int getFactorial(int n){
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        } 
        return n * getFactorial(n - 1);
    }
}
```

## Sample Ouput

```text
10 factorial (iterative) = 3628800
10 factorial (recursive) = 3628800
```
